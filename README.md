## Plus

### Add production-grade services
Added some management services. Spring Boot provides several out of the box with its actuator module,
such as health, audits, beans, and more.

NOTE:
There is also a /shutdown endpoint, but itâ€™s only visible by default via JMX. To enable it as an HTTP endpoint, 
add endpoints.shutdown.enabled=true to your application.properties file.
